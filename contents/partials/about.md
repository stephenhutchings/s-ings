Here you will find  thoughts on technology, some practical advice and a few projects I’m working on. Why not start with one of these:

- Native behaviour and the uncanny valley
- Designing for performance

For me, design is not just about pixel-perfection, well chosen typography and balanced compositions. Its about understanding constraints, solving problems and making beautiful things that people actually want to use. I believe that you can’t be a good designer if you don’t know how the technology works, and that’s why I put equal focus into having the development skills to build what I design.

At [CLD][1] I help to build better products for our clients and our company.
