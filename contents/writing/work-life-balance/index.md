#### On Work/Life Balance

I like to think that if you take time spent at work as proportion of life, you'll come up with fair approximation of the quality of your work. Unless you have the passion to spend more hours of the day working toward your goals, you won't get much more than a passing grade.

This doesn't have to be the hard work it appears to be. All sorts of activities will drive you to work better and to work smarter. Solving problems, judging the flaws and successes in the solutions of others and simple conscious obversation all fall under this umbrella.
