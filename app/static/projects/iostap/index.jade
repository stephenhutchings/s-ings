    #### How to use it

    Download the source files from the build directory, or use Bower.

    ```
    $ bower install zepto.iostap
    ```

    Then you're good to go. You can listen for "iostap" events on any old element. For example:

    ```
    $("a.link").on("iostap", function(e) {
      console.log(e.currentTarget);
    })
    ```

    #### Tell me more

    `zepto.iostap` is a plugin designed to work on top of Zeptoâ€™s pre-existing 
    touch event module. It mimics the behaviour of tapping a button in the iOS 
    ecosystem with a great degree of precision, affording developers who build 
    hybrid web apps a greater user experience for their users. zepto.iostap is 
    a super-lightweight library, weighing in at about 1kb, and doesn't add 
    unecessary overhead client-side.

    Under the hood, there is more going on than you might think.

    The library aims to acheive several goals in imitating the native iOS tap:

    - Tapping on an element and releasing near that element triggers an 
      "iostap" event.
    - Moving a significant distance away from the original element with your 
      finger cancels the event, unless your finger returns to the element 
      without leaving the surface of the touch device.
    - When an element is active, the element (and all of its parent elements), 
      are given an `__active` class, so that you can control their appearance 
      with CSS. For example: `a.button.__active {...}`.
    - If you start a tap on an element, but it or its parents begin to scroll, 
      the tap event is cancelled.
    - The "iostap" event is triggered regardless of whether the device is touch
      -enabled or not, so you can use it in any environment without extra 
      configuration.
    - The library reverts to click events if window.getComputedStyle is 
      unavailable, making it compatible with IE 8.
