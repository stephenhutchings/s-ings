  h2 Details

  h4 Impersonal

  :marked
    Each icon is designed to maximise consistency, while staying out
    of the way. Similar to typeface design where no character should stand out,
    no icon should draw too much attention to itself. This means
    the set is ready to drop into any greenfield project to get up and running
    straight away.

  h4 No extras

  :marked
    Where possible, all non-essential details have been removed from the font.
    Pictograms that are unlikely to be used in an interface have been removed
    to ensure file size remains under 5kb. You won't find any lifestyle or
    automotive iconography. Border radii less than 32 units have
    been squared off, as these are not visible when rendered at 24 or 32px.

  h4 Icon Width

  :marked
    Icons are not fixed width, but do share common side bearings where it
    makes sense. For example, the `volume-low` icon is narrower than the
    `volume-high` icon, but both have the same left side bearing. This means
    you can easily switch between the two when the UI state changes, with
    no shift in the unchanged components of the icon.

    It also means that a row of icons will not appear to have uneven white
    space between them. If you need to fix the width, you can easily do so
    with CSS.


  h4 Ligatures

  :marked
    Where an icon is composed of other icons, you can use the two characters
    together to form a ligature glyph. All ligatures work in either direction.
    Ligatures may not work in all browsers.

  .flex-grid.ligatures
    for ligature in project.ligatures
      p.ligature
        - var lig = ligature.match(/sub ([\w\-]+) ([\w\-]+)/)
        - var c1 = _.find(project.iconList, {class: "mu-" + lig[1]}).code
        - var c2 = _.find(project.iconList, {class: "mu-" + lig[2]}).code
        span.mu.txt-24.txt-vm(class="mu-" + lig[1])
        span.txt-vm &emsp;+&emsp;
        span.mu.txt-24.txt-vm(class="mu-" + lig[2])
        span.txt-vm &emsp;=&emsp;
        span.mu.txt-24.txt-vm.txt-liga &#x#{c1};&#x#{c2};
  //- p
    span.mu-search
    | &emsp;+&emsp;
    span.mu-minus
    | &emsp;=&emsp;
    span.mu.txt-liga &#xE739;&#xE70B;


  h4 Construction Grid

  :marked
    Icons are constructed on a 512 unit grid, divided into 16x16 cells. Every
    node is snapped to a unit on the grid, which helps to reduce file size by
    removing unneeded decimal precision. The 512 unit grid means icons render
    crisply at 16, 24 and 32 pixel sizes. But icons donâ€™t follow the glyph
    slavishly. Inline icons

    The shaded area gives a sense of where the bulk of visual weight lies for
    each glyph.
