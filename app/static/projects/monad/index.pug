        Monad Sans is a typeface that builds on traditional and modern
        grotesques â€” aspiring to be a modern workhorse, rugged but not wooden,
        geometric yet limber. Available in eight weights, it has a medium
        x-height and generous character width.

        The font family inherits some of the forms of an italic face, with a
        curl on the bottom right terminals of R, m, n, h and u. Otherwise sharp
        letter forms have an open appearance, drawing focus from each character
        through the text. The design is intended to work well in digital
        environments, balancing the needs of smaller text and display sizes.

        Monad has an extensive glyph range, covering Western, Central and South
        Eastern European Latin and basic Greek. For digital contexts, it is
        packaged with common icons and pictograms mapped to valid Unicode
        points.

        OpenType font features such as discretionary ligatures, tabular and
        old-style numerals, small caps and stylistic sets are also included.
