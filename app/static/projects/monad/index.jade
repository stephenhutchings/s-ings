      | Monad Sans is my first attempt at a professional grade typeface. Itâ€™s
      | inspired by traditional and modern grotesques. It is available in 
      | eight weights and has a medium x-height and generous character width.

      | Monad is currently a work in progress and not available for general 
      | use, but get in touch if you are interested in using it in a project.
