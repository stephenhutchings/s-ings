    #### How to use it

    Download the source files from the build directory, or use Bower.

    ```
    $ bower install zepto.revolver
    ```

    Then you're good to go. You can create a new Revolver carousel on any element. For example:

    ```javascript
    $(".my-carousel").revolver(options);
    ```

    #### Tell me more

    `zepto.revolver` is responsive and you can define custom breakpoints. It 
    responds to touch and can be dragged this way and that. It’s set up with 
    sane defaults, but of course, these can be overriden. It fires events when 
    things happen and exposes public methods to put you in control. It also 
    uses hardware acceleration for transitions (if they're available), making 
    it a great choice for mobile or devices with limited performance resources.

    Revolver is compatible with jQuery and Zepto, but requires Zepto’s data 
    module for compatability.

    #### Available options

    ```javascript
    var options = {
      // The transition speed if the user drags the panels
      draggingMS: 300,

      // The transition speed if the user selects a pagination item
      controlsMS: 800,

      // False if no autoplay, or a duration in milliseconds
      autoplayMS: 5000,

      returnToStart: true
      returnToStartMS: 1000,

      // Whether or not hovering will cause the autoplayMS to pause
      stopOnHover: true,

      // Should we have previous and next buttons, and what should they say?
      navigation: ["&larr;", "&rarr;"],

      // Should we have pagination, and should it include numbers in the html?
      pagination: true,
      paginationNumbers: false,

      // The number of items to show within the revolver
      items: 5,

      // An array of [pixel width, visible items] or false if
      // we shouldn't be responsive
      breakpoints: [
        [1199, 4],
        [ 979, 3],
        [ 768, 2],
        [ 479, 1]
      ]
    }
    ```
