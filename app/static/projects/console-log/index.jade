        | Most computer generated artwork explores abstract, mathematical 
        | relationships and systems. While this can result in interesting 
        | effects, this project has a different aim. Each illustration in the 
        | series is programmatically drawn by an algorithm, but the goal is to 
        | recreate the rendering of an illustrator rather than computer. This 
        | is acheived by imitating the soft corners and crisp edges of linocut 
        | printing techniques, the unintentional mistakes of the human hand 
        | and the undirected wandering of natural variation. The working title 
        | “console.log” is a wry allusion to the frequent need to log
        | information in the process of constructing the drawings.

          The oblique projection is made of two main components, the open
          cut circular face of the timber and the extruded solid behind. The 
          face is made of a series of concentric rings, each constructed from 
          a set of bezier paths, slightly varying as the extend from the 
          center. Cracks in the timber are added as elongated simple polygons 
          drawn radially from the center. A patch of grainy texture is also 
          added, although this may be lost in the final process.

          The extrusion is made of two basic components — the filled repeated 
          outer ring translated in some direction and a series of curved 
          strokes made parallel to this projection.

          The log is then processed using a combination of added noise, 
          blurring and color quantization. The final step partially recenters 
          the log after the extrusion.

          Each design is available as a limited edition print on high-quality 
          archival A3 stock. If you’re interested in getting your hands on one 
          of these, [get in touch][1].
