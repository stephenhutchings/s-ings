    This was conceived as a simple but fun book for children and adults, and 
    remains a work in progress. Eventually I would like to couple each page 
    with a facing page of illustrations for each name.

    With 388 names over 10 pages, itâ€™s nearly impossible to make it through
    in one run. My favourite is the couplet:

    > Jared, Jacob, Giaconda.<br>
    > Molly, Wanda, Wally, Rhonda.
