      Asterisms charts the night sky onto an A2 poster. The projection 
      distorts the both hemispheres onto a circle, giving a combined view of 
      the northern and sourthen skies. The ecliptic path can be seen swerving 
      through the centre of the chart, as can the Milky Way’s cluster of 
      stars. This work is an adaptation of a sky chart from
      [Allsky Asterisms][1], with many modifications and liberties taken.

      Below are some details of the star chart. The typefaces used include
      Effra from [Dalton Maag][2] and [The Lost Type Co-op’s][3] Klinic Slab.
