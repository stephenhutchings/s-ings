              I sit at the intersection of design and front-end
              development, working with a small and talented team as the lead
              designer. It’s my job to make sure every&shy;thing looks great
              and works intuitively, building digital products that are fit
              for purpose and full of joy. Every time you read, click, search,
              tap, drag, delete, edit or sign in, I’m the one who designs and
              builds that user&nbsp;experience.

                I’m all about balancing the big picture with the nitty gritty.
                I make decisions about the best way to introduce new features,
                how they fit into the user experience and how we can achieve
                great results within technical and time constraints.
                Then I get my hands dirty. On any given day, you might find me
                with my design hat on, creating wireframes, mock-ups, graphics
                and animations, style guides, logos and any other artwork.
                Otherwise I’ll be working on the front-end, producing
                prototypes, implementing designs, tweaking interactions,
                reviewing code or writing&nbsp;documentation.

                My full time role is only half the story. I’m always busy
                working  away on other projects. At the moment I’m
                moonlighting as a type designer,  creating a number of
                different retail fonts. This text is set in the  latest, a
                typeface called <strike>[Philippa]</strike> [Antipode]. In the past, I’ve created an  iOS
                app for creatives to manage colour swatches on the go. You
                might  know [Typicons], one of the first freely-available icon
                fonts. I’ve  also written a number of open source front-end
                libraries, which you  can find on [GitHub]. My interest in
                design fields that interrelate with my work keeps me engaged
                and provides fresh insight into the  problems that need to be
                solved day&#x2011;to&#x2011;day.

                I want to make better digital products. I
                get excited about the small details – microcopy, tone of voice,
                typography, motion – as well as the big picture – user
                journeys, information hierarchy, business logic, brand
                positioning. You need both to create beautiful,
                well-designed solutions.
